            <h4>EMpy</h4>

            <p><code>EMpy (Electromagnetic Python)</code> (not to be confused with <a href="http://www.alcyone.com/software/empy/">empy</a>) is a suite of numerical algorithms widely used in electromagnetism.</p>
            <p>The package contains:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>an isotropic and anisotropic transfer matrix algorithm;</li>
                <li>an isotropic and anisotropic rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA)
                algorithm;</li>
                <li>the numerical model of the frequency response of different
                well-known devices (Mach-Zehnder, Ring Resonators, etc.).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This list, very short by now, will hopefully enlarge to include an FDTD and an interface to the many very good software used in electromagnetism out there.</p>

                <p>The isotropic transfer matrix algorithm can be used to study
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-reflective_coating">anti-reflection coatings</a>. A very simple single layer anti-reflection
                coating, described <a
                    href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/phyopt/antiref.html#c1">here</a>,
                is computed by the following script.</p>

                <script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/lbolla/EMpy/blob/master/examples/ex_transfer_matrix_2.py"></script>

                <p>In the lines 8-12 the multilayer is defined. Indices and
                thicknesses are chosen so that a single layer of refractive index 1.38
                and thickness about one quarter of the central wavelength 1.55um is
                positioned between two semi-infinite layers of air and glass. This
                gives theoretically no reflection for the central wavelength. The
                following graph is the result, which confirms the theoretical predictions.</p>

                <p>The graph shows two curves, one for each polarization. They differ
                because the incident plane wave is tilted by 10 degrees (line 15).</p>

                <p>Four curves are clearly visible because the two polarizations behave in
                a different way, even if the incidence is normal (line 16-17), because
                of the anisotropic material (line 5).</p>

                <p>In lines 4 and 5 the two coupling coefficients and the two coupler losses
                are defined. The length of the ring is defined in line 6, while its
                effective index is supposed to be the one of a silicon rib waveguide
                of 488nm x 220nm at room temperature.

                <p>The maximum drop power is 0 dB because no losses are considered,
                and periodic with the period being the FSR of the ring.

            <p>After the "imports", a list of couplers is defined: four, in this
            case, because the resonator is made of 3 rings. Then, the arcs
            connecting the resonators are defined: the rings are supposed to be
            all equal, and the couplers are on the diameters of the
            rings. Finally, the rings are supposed to have an effective index
            equal to a 400nm x 200nm straight waveguide, at 125 degrees.

            <p>The drop is always lower than 0 dB because the coupling

            in an anisotropic multilayer. The multilayer is made of 7 layers, the
            4th being a binary grating made with an anisotropic (SiN, rotated with
            the optical axis not aligned with the coordinate axis) and an
            isotropic (BPTEOS) material. Incidence is not normal. A comparison of
            the reflectivity is made with a similar multilayer, where the grating
            layer has been substituted by an "effective" isotropic layer.
